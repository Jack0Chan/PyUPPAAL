    "`pyuppaal` is a research tool that helps you do most things that you can do with UPPAAL GUI. Basic coding flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load a .xml model, just like you open a model in UPPAAL GUI;\n",
    "2. set the query, just like you edit the queries in UPPAAL GUI;\n",
    "3. verify a model with the query and options (e.g., shortest path), just like you click the \"Verify\" button in UPPAAL GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, you can also\n",
    "\n",
    "- load a .xtr trace, and get the formatted trace data;\n",
    "- modify templates, declaration and systems;\n",
    "- add built-in templates such as Input, Observer, and Monitors; \n",
    "- find all patterns of the model with certain query.\n",
    "- [todo] analyze the *SMC* simulation results. \n",
